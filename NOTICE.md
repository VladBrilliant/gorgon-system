GORGON SYSTEM — Consciousness-Inspired Monitoring & Adaptive Intelligence Framework  
© 2025 Vladimir Brilliantov

This project introduces an original bio-inspired system architecture consisting of:

- **Rhopalia Sensors** – modular metric acquisition units  
- **Crabs Monitoring Agents** – multi-sensor collectors with local buffers  
- **Octopus Hub** – central routing, aggregation and coordination layer  
- **Gorgon Bell** – analytical and visualization layer (Subumbrella & Exumbrella)  
- **MAI Engine (Memory–Attention–Inference)** – adaptive inference model (future extension)

All architectural patterns, terminology, naming conventions and structural design  
were fully conceived, defined, and introduced by **Vladimir Brilliantov**.

These concepts are original intellectual work and form the core identity  
of the Gorgon System project.

## Naming and Design Philosophy

The system uses a biomimetic model inspired by medusozoa neural structures  
and cephalopod sensory organization:

- Rhopalia = sensory nodes  
- Crabs = multi-sensor carriers  
- Octopus = central intelligence  
- Gorgon Bell = perception layer  
- MAI = adaptive cognition  

This naming scheme is unique to the project and part of its intellectual identity.
