If you witness behaviour that violates this Code:

1. You may open an issue (if you feel comfortable).
2. You may contact the project owner privately via the email listed on the GitHub profile.
3. Reports will be reviewed carefully, respectfully and confidentially.

Violations may result in:

- a warning,
- temporary removal from participation,
- blocking from the repository,
- or other actions deemed appropriate by the maintainer.

The primary goal of enforcement is **education, improvement and safety**, not punishment.

- Uphold and enforce this Code of Conduct fairly and consistently.
- Provide guidance and support to contributors.
- Lead by example in professionalism and respectful communication.

## 🧬 6. Project Identity and Architectural Integrity

Gorgon System is built on a unique bio-inspired architecture
(Rhopalia Sensors, Crabs Monitoring Agents, Octopus Hub,
Gorgon Bell, MAI Engine).

Participants must respect the conceptual integrity of the project.
Architectural names and metaphors should not be misused, distorted,
or intentionally confused.

Innovations and extensions are welcome — but they must align with the vision.
